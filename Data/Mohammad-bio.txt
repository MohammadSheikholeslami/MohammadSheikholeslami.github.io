I am currently a PhD student in the Multimedia Laboratory of the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. I have an extensive background in probabilities, machine learning, communications, and signal processing. My current research interests include Multi-Modal Distributed Machine Learning in the next generation of communication networks (5G and 6G). I enjoy working with probabilities and mathematics, and I have full proficiency in Python and MATLAB.
